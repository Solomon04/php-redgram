Redgram is an open source PHP library that allows users to automatically retrieve content from Reddit and automatically post to Instagram. Because it was built with PHP (<a href="https://laravel-zero.com">Laravel Zero</a> specifically), you can set it up on a server and run a cron that posts for you on a schedule. 

## Getting Started
- Run `composer install` to install require dependencies. 
- Run `cp .env.example .env` to setup your environment variables. 
- Run `php redgram main` to setup your credentials and begin posting to Instagram
